            Our estimates are designed for preliminary budgeting and planning
            purposes. They are based on standardized, up-to-date market rates
            for materials and labor in India. However, actual costs can vary
            significantly based on your specific location, choice of brands,
            quality of materials, and the contractor you hire.

            We strongly advise against it. This tool should be used as a
            reference to get a ballpark figure. Always obtain detailed, itemized
            quotations from multiple professional contractors before finalizing
            any contract.
